## Introduction
Alzheimer's disease is a neuro-degenerative disease. This disease makes the patient's memory weak, in medical terms, the hippocampal volume of the brain shrinks to below average. The main purpose of the project is to help with early detection of Alzheimer's, which will help the medical researchers and doctors to put the patient on early medication and to help prevent it from getting worse.
## Working

The methodology is divided into five major steps which perform different tasks like data selection, pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection and prediction.

1. Data selection

The data has specific patient related information which is related to the changes in the body of the human being. The data used is observed from the lifestyle and medical records. This further leads to next task which is pre-processing which is applied to normalize the dataset using normalizing.

2. Pre-processing

In this task, the raw data obtained is being transformed into a type of data which can be given to algorithms of Machine learning. 
This task is very much necessary to fasten the training process. The dataset taken directly may be inconvenient or may not be understood by the system which will eventually lead to errors. Pre- processing of the data helps in solving all the issues of the dataset.

3. Feature extraction

Neuroimaging techniques like MRI, CT scans are best for detecting AD at an early stage. 
Many a times whole image is not considered also, so to avoid taking unnecessary part of the image, feature extraction is performed. Further in feature extraction feature highlighting is done to reduce the processing time and then the process goes ahead to detection of early-stage symptoms of the disease. This task helps in reducing the cost and also helps in achieving better results.

4. Feature selection

This task deals with the size issues. This process is very effective in optimizing the performance of Machine Learning algorithms. This task helps in selecting the features which are needed.
The three main goals of the feature selection include improving the performance prediction of the model, structuring the cost-effective methodology to get better results and realizing good form of process on the data received from previously performed tasks.

5. Prediction

Performing all the above steps leads us to the final step i.e prediction. This step predicts the presence of AD. The dataset obtained from OASIS has 150 subjects and 15 colums, out of these 15 only 7 columns or features helped in predicting the disease with higher accuracy.
